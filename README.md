## Controls
- Move with W/A/S/D

The time it took you to perform the exercise:
3:57h (15:00 to 18:57)

## The parts that were difficult for you and why
At the beginning I was nervous, the first 2 hours.
I've had problems to find the perfect way to customize physics to make good response.

## The parts you think you could do better and how
I think all can be done better
- I can improve phyisics response
	- Setting better physic properties
- Camera movement (to make it more smoothly)
	- Maybe calculating the trajectory to the objective and making a better movement with curves
- UI is the basic from Unity
	- Planing better the UI, make UI is not complex, but thinking on the design it could improve a lot.
- Better feedback to the user (at taking points or at receiv hits)


## What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
- Make more "enemies/traps"
- Improve player skills (jump, maybe a dash(but i dont know if fits with this kind of games))
- Improve UI graphics
- Make main menu
- Also it could be nice to put a body with physics, just as a graphic improvement (bouncing head & arms...).
- Do it for Android/iOS

## What did you think
At the beginning i was really nervous, I had some times of blocking.

## Any comment you may have
Not too much, I really have enjoied doing this test, with the nerves and the time limit maybe i have thinked less about the game design and mechanics, but it's fine.
